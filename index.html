            <p>There was a princess who loved to code. She would spend her days coding away, creating beautiful and intricate programs for her kingdom. One day, the coding princess decided to challenge herself and create a program that could track the feeding habits and health of all of the dragons in her lands. </p>

            <p>She was very excited about the new dragoncare program, even bringing in the local veterinarian and hostler as consultants. Although she knew exactly what she wanted her program to accomplish, she struggled to complete the massive amount of coding required. </p>

            <p>She worked tirelessly on her project, but no matter how hard she tried, she couldn't get it to work. Frustrated, the coding princess almost gave up. But then, as she looked out over the town square, she had an idea. She would ask her coding friends for help! After all, they were experts in coding too. </p>

            <p>The coding princess and her friends got together and formed a plan to finish the code for their dragoncare program. They decided to split up the coding work among themselves, and each one of them worked on their own part of the program. </p>
